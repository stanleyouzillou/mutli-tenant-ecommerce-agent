# Contributing (agent + human)

- Keep PRs small and focused on one feature.
- If a requirement is ambiguous, record two or three options with pros/cons and pick a default in a short design note.
- Respect module boundaries; do not import infra from domain.
- Avoid new dependencies without a rationale; prefer standard libs and official providers.
