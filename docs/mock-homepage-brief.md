# Mock homepage brief (first run)

**Goal**: showcase value instantly with mock data; clickable paths that exercise the skeleton.

**Sections**
1) **Hero**: title “Multi-tenant digital marketplace”; CTA “Open demo storefront”; secondary “Seller dashboard demo”.
2) **Featured storefronts**: 3 tenant cards (logo, brand color, tagline).
3) **Trending products**: grid of 6 items (cover, price, tenant badge).
4) **Demo checkout**: “Buy now (fake)” card that runs the happy path and shows: Payment Succeeded → License Issued → Download Link.
5) **Why it works**: bullets on instant delivery, licensing, analytics.

**shadcn/ui picks**: Card, Button, Badge, Separator, Progress, Skeleton.
